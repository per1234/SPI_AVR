# SPI_AVR
Another alternative SPI library for AVR? NO! It's a collection of SPI methods (and some pin low level routine) to trabsfer fast SPI data, the purpose is create a kind of 'standard' method and a serie of SPI methods libraries to use inside other libraries and in sketches.<br>
Caution, this is an early alpha for testing only, do not use until I've checked carefully.<br>
Currently was still untested so do not cry...
